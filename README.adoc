== Release Notes for SUSE CaaS Platform

You can view these release notes in two ways:

* The official version on the
link:https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/[SUSE Web site].

* The GitHub/GitLab preview of the in-development release notes is at
<<adoc/MAIN.release-notes.adoc#>>.


=== Contributing

Want to help? We love to hear that! Below are a few hints to guide you.

==== Writing

These release notes are written in the AsciiDoc (`*.adoc`) format. For some
great AsciiDoc documentation, see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/.

==== Updating Content

. Fork this repository.

. Make the intended changes. (Make sure to read <<sec.github-preview>>.)

. Validate and build a test version (see below for more details)

. Submit the changes as a pull request

// FIXME: Not completely sure whether we can use Travis here, since this is a
// private repo.
////
Travis CI will automatically check whether your pull request's content is
compatible AsciiDoc.

=== Building the Release Notes Documents

The final version for the product is build in the SUSE Build Service.

For validation and test purposes follow the steps below:

. Install the DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (daps) package from the
link:https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Documentation:Tools/daps[Documentation:Tools]
openSUSE Build Service project.

. Use the `make` to build all required documents. For a single HTML document,
for example `make single-html`.

. Alternatively, you can run the following command, which will build the
  documentation in your local folder, with the help of a container similar
  to what is used in our CI: `docker run  -v ./:/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app susedoc/ci:openSUSE-42.3 make single-html`

=== Keeping the GitHub/GitLab Preview of These Release Notes Intact

The GitHub/GitLab preview mode is handy but comes with a couple of snags compared to
the build of the release notes that is used for the SUSE Web site:

** GitHub/GitLab will simply render a preview of a single `*.adoc` file using
AsciiDoctor's built-in HTML conversion. GitHub/GitLab previews do not support
embedding one AsciiDoc file in another, you can only use links between them.

** The SUSE Web site build combines multiple `*.adoc` files into a single HTML
output file. It is based on AsciiDoctor's AsciiDoc-to-DocBook-XML conversion,
the result of which is then further converted into HTML/PDF using DAPS and the
DocBook XSL stylesheets.

For this reason, the central file `adoc/MAIN.release-notes.adoc` contains
somewhat unsightly `ifdef`/`ifndef` blocks that check whether the file is
displayed in the GitHub/GitLab preview, switching between using links to other files
for GitHub/GitLab and `include::` statement in all other cases.

The issue of not being able to embed other AsciiDoc files when using the GitHub/GitLab
preview also affects the "attribute entries" file `adoc/entities.adoc`.
Attribute entries allow easily referencing text used multiple (similar to
entities in XML).
Hence, for the GitHub/GitLab preview, each file contains a copy of the entire attribute
entry file at the top. When updating attribute entries, always make sure to:

  . Edit `adoc/entities.adoc` first (these are used for the regular build)
  . Run `make update-entries` to update the dependent attribute entries in each
  of the `*.adoc` files (these are used for GitHub/GitLab previews).


=== Updating the Release Notes on the Website

The website is automatically updated when we release a new version of the
`release-notes-caasp` package as maintenance update.
