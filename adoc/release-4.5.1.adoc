* CVE-2020-12603: "Envoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or earlier may consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/2 requests or responses with many small (i.e. 1 byte) data frames."
* CVE-2020-12604: "Envoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or earlier is susceptible to increased memory usage in the case where an HTTP/2 client requests a large payload but does not send enough window updates to consume the entire stream and does not reset the stream."
* CVE-2020-12605: "Envoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or earlier may consume excessive amounts of memory when processing HTTP/1.1 headers with long field names or requests with long URLs."
* CVE-2020-8663:  "Envoy version 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or earlier may exhaust file descriptors and/or memory when accepting too many connections."
* CVE-2020-15187: "In Helm before version 3.3.2, a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack."
* CVE-2020-15185: "In Helm before version 3.3.2, a Helm repository can contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository."
* CVE-2020-15184: "In Helm before version 3.3.2 there is a bug in which the `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart."
* CVE-2020-15186: "In Helm before version 3.3.2 plugin names are not sanitized properly. As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `hellm --help`."

=== Known Issues

* https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1176225 - Upgraded v4.5 cluster is running etcd from v4 namespace
* https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1172270 - cilium-init:1.6.6 does not exist in registry
* Kubeproxy is not fully deprecated since envoyproxy requires support of Linux Kernel 5.3 and upwards.
* If the cluster node(s) was bootstrapped/joined before kubernetes version 1.17, you have to manually modify the contents of `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` to point to the automatically rotated kubelet client certificates by replacing `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` with:
+
[source,bash]
----
client-certificate: /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
client-key: /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
