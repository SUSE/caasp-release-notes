== Changes in 4.2.0

=== {kube} update

FILLIN what is new


=== Addon customization persistence

This release adds `kustomize` to persist addon configuration changes across updates and reboots.


=== skuba: Disabling firewalld

skuba should disable firewalld when bootstrapping/joining a node. Adds a startup step to check that firewalld is disabled. This was done using cloud init but this would not work on bare metal, so we make skuba ensure firewalld is disabled.


=== datastore for vmware

{vmware} {tf} config now supports setting a datastore cluster as the storage backend. Please refer to the  link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-deployment/_deployment_instructions.html#_deploying_vms_from_the_template[Deployment Instructions] for more information.

=== Known issues

==== Updating packages without updating k8s

FILLIN


=== Required Actions

==== Kubernetes 1.17

In order to update to kubernetes 1.17, follow the instructions in the admin guide https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_updating_kubernetes_components .

MENTION known bug


==== conmon and cri-o

Conmon and cri-o will be updated by `skuba-update`. No action is required from your side. For more info see https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_base_os_updates


==== skuba

In order to update skuba, you need to update the admin workstation. See detailed instructions at https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_update_management_workstation


==== Generate the `kustomize` style addon configurations

You must convert your addon manifests to the new `kustomize` aware file structure and formats.
To do so please run the following command from your management workstation.

Replace `MASTER-NODE-IP` with an IP address/FQDN of one of your master nodes.
Replace `CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH` with the path to your existing cluster defintion files that were generated during the intial bootstrap/deployment.

----
skuba cluster init --control-plane MASTER-NODE-IP /tmp/new-cluster-init
mv CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/addons CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/addons-old
cp -r /tmp/new-cluster-init/addons CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/
----

This will generate the existing addon configurations in the new format so you can amend them.


=== Deprecations in 4.2.x

- The hyperkube image, combining multiple kubernetes binaries, is planned for
  removal in 4.3.0, due to upstream deprecations.
  If running {productname} in an airgapped environment, please ensure that all
  our images are mirrored.

== Changes in 4.1.2

=== Deployment on AWS as Technology Preview

Deployment of {productname} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been tested and documented.
{tf} is used to deploy the infrastructure and the `skuba` tool to bootstrap the {kube} cluster on top of it.
For detailed instructions please see link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/single-html/caasp-deployment/#_deployment_on_amazon_aws[the Deployment Guide].
Please note that {productname} deployment on AWS may not be functionally complete, and is not intended for production use.

=== Terraform Upgrade

{productname} can now be deployed with *{tf} 0.12*. All details of the new version
can be found in the link:https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-0-1-2-preview/[HashiCorp Documentation].
The official website for the {tf} 0.12 upgrade is https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html.

=== etcd Backup and Restore for Master Nodes Disaster Recovery

* Provide etcd backup process on-demand or on a schedule to prevent etcd data corruption.
* Provide etcd restore process to recover failed master node(s) to restore etcd quorum for cluster serving.

For detailed instructions please see link: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/single-html/caasp-admin/#_backup_etcd_cluster_data[the Administration Guide].

=== Velero for Disaster Recovery

* Provide Velero as a solution for data protection and data migration by backing up and migrating Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes to and from externally supported storage backend on demand or on a schedule.

For detailed instructions please see link: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/single-html/caasp-admin/#_disaster_recovery[the Administration Guide].

=== Required Actions

==== Upgrade {tf} Files and State

In order to seamlessly switch to {tf} 0.12 you need to make sure that:

* All files follow the new syntax for the link:https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl[HashiCorp Configuration Language] included in {tf} 0.12
* All boolean values are `true` or `false` and *not* 0 or 1
* All variables are explicitly declared
* All dependencies are explicitly declared to reach the expected behavior

==== Recommended Procedure

Enter your {tf} files/state folder and:

* Install the latest version of {tf} using `zypper in terraform` (the installed version should be 0.12.19)
* Navigate to your {tf} root folder (e.g. `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/vmware`)
* Migrate {tf} files with the automatic migration tool by running `terraform 0.12upgrade`
** For OpenStack, run the <<terraform-openstack-extra-ops>> (see below)
** Run `terraform apply` to update the {tf} definitions to the new format used by 0.12
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not update the definitions before running {tf} again your output might contain `nil`/`null` strings when you run `terraform refresh` followed by `terraform output`.
This can break automations that are based on the output. Please make sure you have updated/applied all definitions before running {tf}.
====
* Run `zypper up skuba`
* You can then run the `terraform init/plan/apply` commands as usual.

[[terraform-openstack-extra-ops]]
==== Extra Operations for In-place Upgrade of OpenStack {tf} Files

* Replace any boolean values written as a number with `false`/`true`.
  For example, for the variables in `openstack/variables.tf`
  (and their equivalent in your `terraform.tfvars` file), replace
  `default = 0` with `default = false` in the variables
  `workers_vol_enabled` and `dnsentry`. Do the same for
  any extra boolean variable you might have added.
* Introduce a `depends_on` on the resource `"openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2" "master_ext_ip"` in `master-instance.tf`:
+
----
depends_on = [openstack_compute_instance_v2.master]
----
+
* Introduce a `depends_on` on the resource `"master_wait_cloudinit"` in `master-instance.tf`:
+
----
depends_on = [
  openstack_compute_instance_v2.master,
  openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2.master_ext_ip
]
----
+
* Introduce a `depends_on` on the resources
  `"openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2" "worker_ext_ip"` and
  `"null_resource" "worker_wait_cloudinit"` in `worker-instance.tf`, similarly to the ones for master.
  Replace `master` with `worker` in the examples above.
* Update the resources `resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "master"`
  and `resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "worker"` with
  `master-instance.tf` and `worker-instance.tf` respectively. Add the following resources:
+
----
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [user_data]
}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The above option is needed because {tf} will detect all machines as new resources when `user_data` changes during the upgrade.
====
+
This will make it possible to update your cluster from a {tf} 0.11 state
into a {tf} 0.12 state without tearing it down completely.

[WARNING]
=========
When adding `lifecycle { ignore_change = [user_data] }` in your master and
worker instances, you will effectively prevent updates of nodes, should you or
SUSE update the `user_data`. This should be removed as soon as possible after the
migration to {tf} 0.12.
=========

==== etcdctl
Run `zypper in etcdctl` in the management host to install etcdctl.

==== Update packages for general fixes
Update `skuba` package and `patterns-caasp-Management` on your management workstation as you would do with any other package.

Refer to: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-admin/#sec-zypper-softup-update[https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-admin/#sec-zypper-softup-update]

Updating `patterns-caasp-Management` will install the new terraform providers for AWS.

Packages on your cluster nodes (cri-o) will be updated automatically by `skuba-update` link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_base_os_updates

== Changes in 4.1.0

=== {kube} update

{productname} now ships with {kube} {kube_version}.
Most of the significant changes relate to this upgrade, as more than 31 enhancements were merged in the {kube} {kube_version} release.
You can read a short summary of the changes under <<kubernetes_updates>>.
Manual actions are required for 4.1.0 release.

=== Helm security update

Moreover, helm has been updated to fix a security issue (link:https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18658/[CVE-2019-18658]).

=== Stratos, a web console for {kube}

Stratos is now available as tech preview for {productname}. Stratos is a
web console for {kube} and for Cloud Foundry.
A single instance of Stratos can be used to monitor and interact with different
{kube} clusters as long as their API endpoints are reachable by Stratos.

Stratos integrates with Prometheus: it can scrape metrics collected
by Prometheus and show them using pre-built charts.

Finally Stratos can be used to interact with helm chart repositories. It can
show the charts available and install them straight from its web interface.
It can also show all the workloads that are running on a {kube} that have
been created by helm chart.

[NOTE]
====
The helm chart integration is a tech preview feature of Stratos
that must be enabled at deployment time.
====

=== Required Actions

==== Skuba and helm update Instructions

Update skuba and helm on your management workstation as you would do with any other package.

Refer to: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-admin/#sec-zypper-softup-update[https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-admin/#sec-zypper-softup-update]

[WARNING]
====
When running helm-init you may hit a link:https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1159047[known bug on the certificate validation]:

----
https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com is not a valid chart repository or cannot be reached: Get https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/index.yaml: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
----

In order to fix this, run:

----
sudo update-ca-certificates
----

====


After updating helm to latest version on the management host, you have to also upgrade the helm-tiller image in the cluster, by running:

----
helm init \
    --tiller-image registry.suse.com/caasp/v4/helm-tiller:2.16.1 \
    --service-account tiller --upgrade
----

==== Upgrade Your {kube} Cluster

Use skuba to upgrade your {kube} cluster as link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/single-html/caasp-admin/#handling_updates[documented in the Administration guide].

[WARNING]
====
Please, do not run `zypper patch` manually on your nodes.
If you do, you will see an error about a conflict when patching {crio}.
This is expected, because the patch is not supposed to be installed this way.

Instead, cluster updates are being handled by skuba as link:{docurl}/single-html/caasp-admin/#handling_updates[documented in the Administration guide].
====

==== Update Your {kube} Manifests for {kube} {kube_version}:

Some API resources are moved to stable, while others have been
moved to different groups or deprecated.

The following will impact your deployment manifests:

*  `DaemonSet`, `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, and `ReplicaSet` in
  `extensions/` (both `v1beta1` and `v1beta2`) is deprecated.
  Migrate to `apps/v1` group instead for all those objects.
  Please note that `kubectl convert` can help you migrate all the
  necessary fields.
*  `PodSecurityPolicy` in `extensions/v1beta1` is deprecated. Migrate to
  `policy/v1beta1` group for `PodSecurityPolicy`.
  Please note that `kubectl convert` can help you migrate all the
  necessary fields.
*  `NetworkPolicy` in `extensions/v1beta1` is deprecated. Migrate to
  `networking.k8s.io/v1` group for `NetworkPolicy`.
  Please note that `kubectl convert` can help you migrate all the
  necessary fields.
*  `Ingress` in `extensions/v1beta1` is being phased out. Migrate to
  `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` as soon as possible.
  This new API does not need to update other API fields and therefore
  only a path change is necessary.
*  Custom resource definitions have moved from `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`
  to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`.

Please also see https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/ for more details.

=== Known issue: skuba upgrade could not parse "Unknown" as version ====

Running "skuba node upgrade plan" might fail with the error "could not parse "Unknown" as version" when a worker, after running "skuba node upgrade apply", had not fully started yet.

If you are running into this issue, please add some delay after running "skuba node upgrade apply" and prior to running "skuba node upgrade plan".

This is tracked in link:https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1159452[bsc#1159452]


== Changes in 4.0.3

* Prometheus and Grafana: official monitoring solution for {productname}
* Airgap: format change of https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suse-caasp/4/skuba-cluster-images.txt
* 389-ds fixes (see below)
* skuba fixes (see below)

=== Prometheus and Grafana: official monitoring solution for {productname}
Prometheus and Grafana were already link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.0/html/caasp-admin/_monitoring.html#_monitoring_stack[documented] but based on upstream helm charts and containers.

In version {productversion}, official SUSE helm carts and containers are now available in the helm chart repository (`+kubernetes-charts.suse.com+`) and the container registry (`+registry.suse.com+`).

=== Airgap: Format Change

The format of https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suse-caasp/4/skuba-cluster-images.txt was changed to be able to express more data.
Specifically to add skuba and {productname} versions, so that one can match the images that should be pulled with the respective version.

This way, you can run air gapped production and staging clusters with different {productname} versions.

=== Required Actions

==== Skuba Update Instructions

Update skuba on your management workstation as you would do with any other package.

Refer to: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-admin/#sec-zypper-softup[{sls} 15 SP1 Admin Guide: Updating Software with Zypper]

[[required-actions-401]]
=== Required Actions

[[gangway-update]]
==== Update the Gangway Image

The gangway image that shipped with {productname} 4.0 must be updated manually by performing the following step:

====
kubectl set image deployment/oidc-gangway oidc-gangway=registry.suse.com/caasp/v4/gangway:3.1.0-rev4 --namespace kube-system
====

== Known Issues

You must update the gangway container image manually after update (see <<required-actions-401>> ).

For a full list of Known Issues refer to: link:{bugzilla_url}[Bugzilla].

== Supported Platforms

This release supports deployment on:

* {soc} 8
* VMWare ESXi {vmware_version}
* KVM
* Bare metal
+
({productname} {productversion} supports hardware that is certified for {slsa}
through the YES certification program. You will find a database of certified
hardware at https://www.suse.com/yessearch/.)

== What Is New

=== Base Operating System Is Now {slsa} 15 SP1

The previous version used a minimal OS image called MicroOS. {productname}
{productmajor} uses standard {slsa} 15 SP1 as the base platform OS.
{productname} can be installed as an extension on top of that. Because {slsa} 15 is
designed to address both cloud-native and legacy workloads,
these changes make it easier for customers who want to modernize their
infrastructure by moving existing workloads to a {kube} framework.

Transactional updates are available in {slsa} 15 SP1 as a technical preview but {productname}
{productmajor} will initially ship without the transactional-update mechanism enabled.
The regular zypper workflow allows use of interruption-free node reboot.
The {slsa} update process should help customers integrate a {kube} platform
into their existing operational infrastructure more easily, nevertheless transactional
updates are still the preferred process for some customers,
which is why we provide both options.

=== Software Now Shipped as Packages Instead of Disk Image

In the previous version, the deployment of the software was done by downloading and installing a disk
image with a pre-baked version of the product. In {productname} {productmajor}, the software is distributed
as RPM packages from an extension module in {slsa} 15 SP1.
This adaptation towards containers and {sls} mainly gives customers more deployment flexibility.

=== More Containerized Components

We moved more of the components into containers, namely all the control plane components:
`etcd`, `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-scheduler`.
The only pieces that are now running uncontainerized are `CRI-O`, `kubelet` and `kubeadm`.

=== New Deployment Methods

We are using a combination of `skuba` (custom wrapper around kubeadm) and
HashiCorp Terraform to deploy {productname} machines and clusters.
We provide Terraform state examples that you can modify to roll out clusters.

Deployment on bare metal using AutoYaST has now also been tested and documented:
link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-deployment/#deployment_bare_metal[]

[NOTE]
You must deploy a load balancer manually.
This is currently not possible using Terraform.
Find example load balancer configurations
based on {sle} 15 SP1 and Nginx or HAProxy in the __{productname} Deployment Guide__:
https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-deployment/#_load_balancer[]

=== Updates Using Kured

Updates are implemented with `skuba-update`, that makes use of the `kured`
tool and the SLE package manager. This is implemented in the skuba-update
tool which glues zypper and the kured tool (https://github.com/weaveworks/kured).
Kured (KUbernetes REboot Daemon) is a {kube} daemonset that performs safe
automatic node reboots when the need to do so is indicated by the package
management system of the underlying OS. Automatic updates can be manually
disabled and configured: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-admin/#_cluster_updates

=== Automatic Installation of Packages For Storage Backends Discontinued

In previous versions {productname} would ship with packages to support all available storage backends.
This negated the minimal install size approach and is discontinued. If you require a specific software
package for your storage backend please install it using {ay}, {tf} or `zypper`.
Refer to: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-admin/#_software_management


[[kubernetes_updates]]
=== Changes to the {kube} Stack

==== Updated Kubernetes

{productname} {productversion} ships with {kube} {kube_version}.

{kube} version 1.16 contains the following notable changes:

* Custom Resources Definitions (CRD) are out of the beta version and are
  generally available in the `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` group.
* IPv4/IPv6 dual stack is officially in alpha.
Read up about the details of the new features of {kube} 1.16 here:
https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/09/18/kubernetes-1-16-release-announcement/.

{kube} version 1.15 mainly contains enhancements to core {kube} APIs:

* CustomResourceDefinitions Pruning, -Defaulting and -OpenAPI Publishing.
* cluster life cycle stability and usability has been enhanced
  (`kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` can now be used to configure and deploy an HA control plane)
* new functionality of the Container Storage Interface (volume cloning) is available.
Read up about the details of the new features of {kube} 1.15 here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.15.md#115-whats-new

==== CRI-O Replaces Docker

{productname} now uses CRI-O {crio_version} as the default container runtime.
CRI-O is a container runtime interface based on the OCI standard technology.
The choice of CRI-O allows us to pursue our open-source agenda better than competing technologies.

CRI-O's simplified architecture is tailored explicitly for {kube} and has a reduced footprint but also
guarantees full compatibility with existing customer images thanks to its adherence to OCI standards.
Other than Docker, CRI-O allows to update the container runtime without stopping workloads;
providing improved flexibility and maintainabilitty to all {productname} users.

We will strive to maintain {productname}'s compatibility with the Docker Engine in the future.

==== Cilium Replaces Flannel

{productname} now uses Cilium {cilium_version} as the Container Networking
Interface enabling networking policy support.

=== Centralized Logging

The deployment of a Centralized Logging node is now supported for the purpose of
aggregating logs from all the nodes in the {kube} cluster.
Centralized Logging forwards system and {kube} cluster logs to a
specified external logging service, specifically the Rsyslog server,
using {kube} Metadata Module - `mmkubernetes`.


=== Obsolete Components

==== Salt

Orchestration of the cluster no longer relies on Salt.
Orchestration is instead achieved with `kubeadm` and `skuba`.

==== Admin Node / Velum

The admin node is no longer necessary. The cluster will now be controlled
by the master nodes and through API with `skuba` on any {sle} system, such as a local workstation.
This also means the Velum dashboard is no longer available.

== Known Issues

=== Updating to {productname} {productmajor}

In-place upgrades from earlier versions or from Beta 4 version to the generally available release is not supported.
We recommend standing up a new cluster and redeploying workloads. For customers with
production servers that cannot be redeployed, contact SUSE Consulting Services or your
account team for further information.

=== Parallel Deployment

To avoid fails, avoid parallel deployment of nodes.
Joining master or worker nodes to an existing cluster should be done serially,
meaning the nodes have to be added separately one after another.
This issue will be fixed in the next release.
