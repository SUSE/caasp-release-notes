== Changes in 4.2.0

=== Deprecations in 4.2.0

- The hyperkube image, combining multiple {kube} binaries, is planned for
  removal in 4.3.0, due to upstream deprecations.
  If running {productname} in an airgapped environment, please ensure that all
  our images are mirrored.

- Remove ability to re-enable serving deprecated APIs types:
* `extensions/v1beta1`
* `apps/v1beta1`
* `apps/v1beta2`

For more information check: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43214

=== {kube} Update

4.2.0 brings in a {kube} update, precisely to 1.17. The list of features and bug fixes is long, see:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md

=== Addon Customization Persistence

This release introduces `kustomize` to persist addon configuration changes across updates and reboots.


=== Skuba: Disabling `firewalld`

Skuba should disable `firewalld` when bootstrapping/joining a node, so it adds a startup step to check whether `firewalld` is disabled. This was done using cloud init, which however does not work on bare metal deployments. So in order to ensure that `firewalld` is disabled, this check was introduced into `skuba`.

=== Datastore for {vmware}

{vmware} {tf} config now supports setting a datastore cluster as the storage backend. Please refer to the  link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-deployment/_deployment_instructions.html#_deploying_vms_from_the_template[Deployment Instructions] for more information.

=== Required Actions

==== Kubernetes 1.17

In order to update to {kube} 1.17, follow the link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_updating_kubernetes_components[instructions in the Admin Guide].

If your cluster is not on the latest {kube} version prior to applying the update, you will encounter an issue when `skuba-update` tries to update your nodes. See the <<known-issues-420>> section for instructions on how to proceed.


==== Conmon and {crio}

Conmon and {crio} will be updated by `skuba-update`. No action is required from your side. For more info see the link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_base_os_updates[Cluster Updates section in the Admin Guide].


==== Skuba

In order to update `skuba`, you also need to update the admin workstation. For detailed instructions, see link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/html/caasp-admin/_cluster_updates.html#_update_management_workstation[this section in the Admin Guide].


==== Generate the `kustomize` Style Addon Configurations

You must convert your addon manifests to the new `kustomize` aware file structure and formats.
To do so please run the following commands from your management workstation.

Replace `MASTER-NODE-IP` with an IP address/FQDN of one of your master nodes.
Replace `CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH` with the path to your existing cluster defintion files that were generated during the intial bootstrap/deployment.

----
skuba cluster init --control-plane MASTER-NODE-IP /tmp/new-cluster-init
mv CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/addons CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/addons-old
cp -r /tmp/new-cluster-init/addons CLUSTER-DEFINITION-PATH/
----

This will generate the existing addon configurations in the new format so you can amend them.

=== Known Issues

==== `skuba-update` Error: `patterns-caasp-Node` Conflicts with {crio} Update

If your cluster is not up-to-date, meaning it is not in the latest {kube} version, `skuba-update` will try to install the latest version of {crio}, which will create a conflict with
the currently installed {kube} packages.

More precisely, you might encounter an error similar to this:

----
patterns-caasp-Node conflicts with CRI-O
----

In that case, the *recommended solution* is to upgrade the cluster to the latest Kubernetes version available, this can be done by running the regular {productname} Kubernetes upgrade procedure  based on the command `skuba node upgrade`, which is described in the link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/single-html/caasp-admin/#_updating_kubernetes_components[Admin Guide].
