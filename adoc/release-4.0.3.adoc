== Changes in 4.0.3

* Prometheus and Grafana: official monitoring solution for {productname}
* Airgap: format change of https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suse-caasp/4/skuba-cluster-images.txt
* 389-ds fixes (see below)
* skuba fixes (see below)

=== Prometheus and Grafana: official monitoring solution for {productname}
Prometheus and Grafana were already link:https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.0/html/caasp-admin/_monitoring.html#_monitoring_stack[documented] but based on upstream helm charts and containers.

In version {productversion}, official SUSE helm carts and containers are now available in the helm chart repository (`+kubernetes-charts.suse.com+`) and the container registry (`+registry.suse.com+`).

=== Airgap: Format Change

The format of https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suse-caasp/4/skuba-cluster-images.txt was changed to be able to express more data.
Specifically to add skuba and {productname} versions, so that one can match the images that should be pulled with the respective version.

This way, you can run air gapped production and staging clusters with different {productname} versions.

=== Required Actions

==== Skuba Update Instructions

Update skuba on your management workstation as you would do with any other package.
