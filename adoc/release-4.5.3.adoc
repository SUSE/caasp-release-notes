=== Known Issues

Kubernetes public announcement: CVE-2020-8554 Man in the middle using LoadBalancer or ExternalIPs:

Multi-tenant clusters that grant tenants the ability to create and update services and pods are vulnerable. This issue is a design flaw that cannot be mitigated without user-facing changes. With this public announcement, we can begin conversations about a long-term fix.
    
To restrict the use of external IPs we are providing an admission webhook container: k8s.gcr.io/multitenancy/externalip-webhook:v1.0.0. The source code and deployment instructions are published at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/externalip-webhook.
